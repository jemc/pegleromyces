# Pegleromyces

An extensible PEG parser compiler for the
[Myco programming language](https://github.com/jemc/myco).

## Design Goals

Pegleromyces is...

1. Implemented entirely in Myco.

2. Capable of interpreting grammars written in Myco.

3. Sophisticated enough to parse the Myco language itself.

4. Capable of parsing composed grammars for other languages (including user-created languages).

5. Implemented as efficiently as possible given the above constraints.

## The Name
